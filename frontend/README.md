# Front-End Workspace

The front-end will be implemented with React + Vite + ethers v6 following the guide in FrontEnd_Guide_and_Prompt.txt.

## Suggested Setup
1. cd frontend
2. 
pm create vite@latest . -- --template react-ts
3. 
pm install
4. Add dependencies: 
pm install ethers@^6 html5-qrcode zustand jotai
5. Populate src/lib, src/components, src/context, src/abi as described in the guide.

## Environment Variables
Create rontend/.env with:
`
VITE_CHAIN_ID=11155111
VITE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x...
VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:4000/api
`

## Contract Artifacts
Drop the ABI generated by Hardhat into src/abi/FoodTrace.json. Keep addresses per deployment under src/abi/addresses.ts to simplify network switching.
