# CS595 – Blockchain-Based Food Traceability

Repository scaffold for the CS595 final project: a blockchain-backed food batch traceability system with smart contracts, an off-chain storage API, and a React front-end.

## Repository Layout
```
├─ backend/             # Node/Express API for JSON storage + hash verification
├─ docs/                # Architecture notes, API contract, planning artifacts
├─ frontend/            # Vite/React workspace (implementation handled separately)
├─ smart-contracts/     # Hardhat project with FoodTraceability.sol

```
